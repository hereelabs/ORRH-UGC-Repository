# Introduction

This is a repository containing the up-to-date catalog and asset selection for ORRH. This content is compatible with the legacy version of ORRH and the latest version 1.3.0.0. Included in this content is new Map files, Catalog Items, and patches. Contributions are welcome, but please read the contribution requirements before giving it a shot.

For users of ORRH Versions 1.3.0.0 and up, you will automatically download and extract the latest assets from this repository if you are outdated when you open the launcher program.

# Contribution Guidelines

All assets that are contributed to this repository **must** follow the following guidelines:

1. Unoriginal assets must be attributed to the original creator, even if the asset is modified to any degree. You may credit yourself for edits, but the "creator" field in assets.json must include the original creator of said asset. 
2. All assets must include any other assets they rely on, such as textures and meshes.
3. Assets must **not** contain offensive or adult content. This includes assets that contain any form of bigotry or racism.
4. Catalog must not contain any form of scripting, and Maps must not contain any malicious code.
5. Assets must work in every client provided by the launcher. _Obviously_, Shirts and Pants wont work in 2007. But, a Hat should work fine, **with no crashes** in a 2010 client.

Intentionally not following these guidelines will result in you being banned from contributing to this repository. Otherwise, your PR will just be closed.
